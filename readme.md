# db-playground

> Setup any database playground with sample data in seconds

The repository has a simple docker-compose file and a few scripts to set up any database playground with sample data in
seconds. It is a great way to test your database queries and learn about the database.

You can run a single command to setup [Northwind](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Database_Examples/Northwind) dataset
in PostgreSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL and more.

## Usage

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.

After that, you can clone the repository and run the following commands to setup any database.

```shell
# See what you can do with playground
./playground.sh -h

# run all the services using one of the following
./playground.sh
./playground.sh -s all

# run a single service
./playground.sh -s mongo
./playground.sh -s posgres

# clean up the playground
./playground.sh -c

# clean up the playground and run the services
./playground.sh -c -s all
./playground.sh -c -s mongo
./playground.sh -c -s posgres
```

You can also ue the `docker-compose` command directly to run the services.

```shell
# run all the services
docker-compose up -d

# run a single service
docker-compose up -d mongo

# clean up the playground
docker-compose down
```
